Pemberton, led him to create a distinctive tasting soft drink that could be sold at soda fountains. He created a flavored syrup, took it to his neighborhood pharmacy, where it was mixed with carbonated water and deemed “excellent” by those who sampled it. Dr. Pemberton’s partner and bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, is credited with naming the beverage “CocaCola” as well as designing the trademarked, distinct script, still used today.",

It was first developed in West Germany in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to 7 Up. Sprite advertising often makes use of the portmanteau word lymon, a combination of the words lemon and lime. Sprite's slogan is \"Obey Your Thirst\". In the United States, Sprite is the leading lemon-lime flavored soft drink, according to the Coca-Cola Company's website.",
